# ChalÃ© Hotel Site

## A brief study about web design using "floats" and "position" to build liquid layouts

Hi! This is a project i've done for a Udemy course that i'm studying about Fullstack Development, and this is one of the first projects to introduce some fixed and liquid layouts concepts

Yes, i know that **we don't use float and position to create designs nowadays**, that's why this project it's not responsive, but i thought it would be interesting to share may evolution in HTML and CSS
